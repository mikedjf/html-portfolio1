<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Italian For Beginners</h3>
<p>This is my favourite foreign language movie.</p>

<h3>Ali & Ava</h3>
<p>Really touching with a great theme song: Radio by Sylvan Esso.</p>

<h3>Annie Hall</h3>
<p>Funny and touching. Play It Again Sam is another great Woody Allen movie.</p>
